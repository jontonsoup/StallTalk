StallTalk is a toilet based social network founded by Northwestern Computer Science students and avid toilet users. It allows toileteers to anonymously leave messages at a particular stall. Talking to people is simple. Each stall has a unique QR code that links to a webpage that displays posts at that stall. Users simply scan the code, and -- 'Plop!' -- the rest is history.
